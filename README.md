# RFM-Analysis
The RFM analysis is a customer segmentation technique that ranks customers based on three factors:
Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase.
Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases.
Monetary: How much money a customer spends on purchases.
In this project, Pandas is used to preprocess and analyze customer transaction data, calculating RFM scores for each customer. Plotly is then used to create interactive visualizations, such as scatter plots or bar charts, to visually represent the RFM segments and trends in customer behavior. This allows businesses to better understand their customers' value and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
